  Figure 1: The architecture of the proposed Recurrent Optimization Network (RONet) for RGB-T salient object detection, encompassing the Recurrent Optimization (RO) module for multi-modal feature refinement, the Multi-scale Semantic (MS) module for spatial information extraction, and the Detail Enhancement (DE) module for fine-grained feature enhancement, collectively facilitating high-quality salient object detection across multi-modal inputs.

## Installation

We trained and tested our RONet on three public RGB-T datasets: VT5000 , VT1000 , and VT821 . The VT5000 dataset, which is large-scale, contains 5,000 images of day scenes, equally divided into 2,500 training images and 2,500 test images. VT1000 and VT821 datasets include 1,000 and 821 registered RGB-T images, respectively, which are used solely for testing. Our proposed network is implemented using the PyTorch framework and was executed on a computing station equipped with a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 GPU. In this study, the parameters of the dual-modal backbone were initialized using the pre-trained SwinNet model \cite{liu2021swinnet}, while other parameters were randomly initialized. Prior to training, both training and test images were resized to 384 Ã— 384 to minimize the utilization of computing resources.
